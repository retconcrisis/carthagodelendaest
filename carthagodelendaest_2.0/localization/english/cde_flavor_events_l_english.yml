 #Seleukid Civil War Event Chain

 cde_seleukid_civil_war.1.desc: "Two years ago, a man by the name of Alexandros Balas claimed to be the son of the late Basileus Antiochos IV and rebelled against our king in a bid for the Seleukid throne. Backed by the forces of Pergamon, Cappadocia and Egypt, Alexandros has landed in Ake and now invades our lands through Syria. For better or for worse, the time has come to wage a decisive battle against the pretender."
 cde_seleukid_civil_war.1.a: "May the gods give strength to the one true Basileus!"
 cde_seleukid_civil_war.2.t: "Fight for the Seleukid Throne"
 cde_seleukid_civil_war.2.desc: "Two years ago, Alexandros Balas emerged from obscurity and declared his true lineage to the world as the lost son of Antiochos IV of the Seleukid Empire. Now, backed by the Ptolemaic kingdom of Egypt, Pergamon, Cappadocia, and even Rome, Alexandros has landed in Aka with his army. Should we seize #Y Antioch#!, then Alexandros shall finally and rightfully acquire the Seleukid throne."

 cde_seleukid_civil_war.3.t: "War for the Seleukid Throne"
 cde_seleukid_civil_war.3.desc: "A man named Alexandros Balas has claimed the Seleukid throne and now wages war against the Seleukids. Previously, we had promised to support his bid to the throne; in fulfilling our obligation, we have therefore declared war on the Seleukids as well. Backed by the combined might of Egypt, Pergamon and Cappadocia, Alexandros Balas marches towards Antioch with our armies behind him. Should we seize #Y Antioch#!, then Alexandros shall finally and rightfully acquire the Seleukid throne. And for our benefit, such an outcome may destabilize the Seleukid Empire itself..."
 cde_seleukid_civil_war.3.a: "We shall support the true Seleukid basileus, Alexandros"
 cde_seleukid_civil_war.4.t: "Alexandros Balas Victorious!"
 cde_seleukid_civil_war.4.desc: "After a relatively quick yet intense struggle, #Y Alexandros Balas#! and his allied forces besieged the city of Antiocheia. Upon hearing of this, #Y Demetrios I Soter#! rushed to the city. After a narrow battle, we have now received word that Demetrios was slain in battle. With Demetrios gone, the people of Antiocheia have little choice but to accept Alexandros Balas - now Alexandros Seleukid - as Basileus of the empire.\n\nWith the coronation of the new Basileus, Alexandros has taken the epithet Theopator, meaning Divinely Fathered, in honor of his father Antiochos IV. Although the issue of the throne has been decided, the realm has not experienced the most stable of transitions of power. As a result, many local rulers in Mesopotamia and Media have declared independence, and though Alexandros may be content with ruling over Syria, we have much to accomplish before the empire can be stable once more."

 cde_seleukid_civil_war.5.desc: "#Y Alexandros Balas#!, the challenger to the Seleukid throne, has defeated the previous basileus and claimed the empire for himself. With the ascension of a new basileus, it seems that we shall be sending our tribute to a different ruler from here on out. As long as they can ensure their ability to protect our polity, our advisors expect that relatively little will change."

 cde_seleukid_civil_war.6.desc: "Following our initial rebellion against the Seleukids, we have been left alone for the most part due to our victories in battle against the Seleukids. Now, the Seleukid Empire is embroiled in its own civil war, with fighting between the reigning basileus #Y Demetrios#! and a new claimant to the throne, #Y Alexandros Balas#!. Previously, we had established cordial ties with Alexandros and entertained the idea of supporting him in the war due to the tyrannical treatment we faced from the current Seleukid basileus, Demetrios. Now that war has broken out, perhaps now is the time to show Alexandros our committment to his cause in return for a future of cooperation between his new Seleukid state (should he be victorious) and Judea."
 cde_seleukid_civil_war.6.a: "We shall send aid to the rightful basileus, Alexandros."

 cde_seleukid_civil_war.7.desc: "When Alexandros Balas first landed in Syria, we reached out to the ruler of #Y Judea#!, which is currently autonomous after rebelling against the Seleukid Empire. Now, the people of Judea have shown their committment to our cause by lending us their aid as an ally to our cause. Thus, the Judean-Seleukid #Y alliance#! has been secured."

Since now is not the time for grand festivities, the wedding itself will have to wait, at least until Alexandros is victorious and seizes #Y Antiocheia#!."

Although it is possible that he may challenge the throne, he has no real powerbase to speak of. Thus, Alexandros has little concern that the boy will ever become a major threat."

Though we believed him to be of no concern to us, it seems that the boy had raised an army of mercenaries using whatever wealth he could take with him in his flight. Now, he has returned to avenge his father and take the throne for himself. However, Alexandros has only recently assumed his position as the rightful ruler of the kingdom; thus, we can be sure that Alexandros shall not give up his prize without a fight."

Although they intially pledged allegiance to the Ptolemies, the city falling into the hands of the Ptolemies would mean Roman intervention; thus, Antiocheia has chosen to instead side with Demetrios II and support the son of the late Demetrios I, who had fallen at the hands of Alexandros. Losing our capital city so easily has dealt a significant blow to both our war effort as well as the stability of our kingdom."

After we lost direct control over the region during the chaos of the civil war, multiple Mesopotamian dynasts have declared independence from Seleukid rule, and our satrapies of #Y Elymais#! and #Y Characene#! have been effectively cut off from our capital. Thus, they have used this opportunity to wrestle themselves out of Seleukid control."
 cde_seleukid_civil_war.19.a: "Let us put an end to this war so that we may punish the traitors to the east!"

Although a young boy with virtually no power when he was first taken in by the Seleukid official Herakleides, Alexandros has successfully claimed the Seleukid throne thanks to the backing of the Ptolemaic Kingdom, Pergamon, Cappadocia, and even the Maccabean rebels in Judea. Although peace has been attained once more, the destructive civil war has resulted in the Seleukid loss of much of Mesopotamia as well as increased instability in the already-unstable Seleukid realm."

 cde_flavor_mac.1.t: "The Antigonid Claimant Enters Pella"
 cde_flavor_mac.1.desc: "A claimant to the Macedonian throne named Andriskos claims to be the son of Perseus, the last king of Macedonia. Calling for the reunification of the Macedonian people under one standard once more, Andriskos has gained support from the lower classes as well as the citizens of Macedonia who wish to see the land reunited. However, the noble classes are majority pro-Roman, and wish to oppose the perceived pretender. Although accepting him as our ruler may risk war with Rome and our fellow Macedonian republics, many Macedonians have already sided with Andriskos as the savior of Macedonia from Roman oppression."
 cde_flavor_mac.1.a: "Long live Macedonia! Long live the Basileus!"
 cde_flavor_mac.2.t: "War for Macedonian Unification"
 cde_flavor_mac.2.desc: "At this point in our revolution against Rome, the Romans continue to greatly underestimate our military might. Neglecting to send their legion to Macedonia, now is the perfect time to strike. By attacking the other three client republics while Rome is reluctant to fully mobilize against us, we can seize all Macedonian lands and dismantle the client republics before the Romans can directly intervene. Although we will anger them greatly and give them reason for war, now may be the best - or only - chance to unite the Macedonian people."
 cde_flavor_mac.2.a: "The Macedonian people must be united under one banner!"

Seeking to restore the Antigonid dynasty to the Macedonian throne, the pretender known as #Y Andriskos#! has declared war on the Macedonian republics, ourselves included. An even greater concern, Rome has decided not to send their armies to assist us, as they seem to be vastly underestimating the strength of the Antigonid pretender. We even face opposition at home, as several of our cities have already defected to Andriskos in hopes of uniting the Macedonian people. Despite these setbacks, the three remaining republics of Macedonia must join forces to repel the pretender from Pella!"
 cde_flavor_mac.3.a: "No more blood must be shed in Macedonia!"
 cde_flavor_mac.4.t: "Pretender Revolts in Macedonia"
 cde_flavor_mac.4.desc: "An Antigonid pretender by the name of #Y Andriskos#! has risen up in Macedonia, claiming to be the son of Perseus, the last king of Macedonia, the same king that we defeated in the Third Macedonian War. Based on our reports, his force should not be of any worry to us; leading a band of Odrysians, the pretender should be able to be dealt with by the client republics he has waged war against. Most of the Senate would prefer not to waste our legions' time against the pretender."
 cde_flavor_mac.4.a: "A pretender does not deserve to face our best on the field."
 
 #Flavor CAR Carthage
 cde_flavor_car.1.t: "Carthago Delenda Est"
 cde_flavor_car.1.desc: "Though our second war with Carthage ended over half a century ago, debate over the question of Carthage still rages on in the Senate. One especially vocal member of the Senate, Cato, vehemently argues that we must destroy Carthage once and for all, even ending all of his speeches with a certain phrase: 'Furthermore, I consider that Carthage must be destroyed.'\n\nOn the other hand, a faction headed by individuals such as Scipio Nasica Corculum argues that the constant fear of a threatening enemy like Carthage would keep our people in check and united against a common enemy. Still, many of our senators warn of Carthage potentially rising once again, citing the economic prosperity and thriving military of the state from a report just three years ago. Thus, we must make a decision on how to treat the Carthaginian situation."
 cde_flavor_car.1.a: "Carthage must be destroyed!"
 cde_flavor_car.1.b: "Carthage shall be left alone... for now."
 cde_flavor_car.2.t: "Carthage Violates the Treaty!"
 cde_flavor_car.2.desc: "Following the Second Punic War, Carthage lost much of its territory to its neighboring kingdom of Numidia. Additionally, the treaty they signed specified that the Carthaginians shall not wage war unless granted permission by the Roman Senate.\n\nHowever, now Carthage has violated the treaty by declaring war without our permission. If Carthage wins, we fear that they will become an even greater rival to Roman dominance economically and militarily. On the other hand, even if Carthage loses, we do not want the city of Carthage to fall into the hands of any other power either, lest they become another threat to Rome. Thus, the pro-war faction in Rome calls for arms to be taken up against the Carthaginians."

 cde_flavor_car.3.t: "Rome Threatens Intervention!"
 cde_flavor_car.3.desc: "By declaring war as an aggressor against another state, we had violated our treaty with the Romans that was signed after the second Roman-Carthaginian war, which stated that Carthage shall not declare war without permission from Rome. As a result, now the Roman Senate threatens to go to war with us over this violation.\n\nWe can send envoys now to appease the Romans and promise them that we shall lay down our arms and cease our offensive war. However, this may do little to appease the warhawks in the Roman Senate who wish to see our city's destruction regardless of our promises. Even so, perhaps it is worth sending envoys if it means the slim possibility to avoid bloodshed."

 cde_flavor_car.4.desc: "Although the Carthaginians violated the treaty by declaring an offensive war, the Carthaginians have sent a group of envoys requesting peace with Rome, and in return they shall lay down their arms and cease any and all wars in which they are the aggressors. Although their words are sincere - they are likely terrified of our might - many in the Senate have waited decades for the opportunity to crush Carthage once and for all. Furthermore, if Carthage is attacked in a defensive war, then we will not have the pretext to intervene if their capital city falls without a proper fight."
