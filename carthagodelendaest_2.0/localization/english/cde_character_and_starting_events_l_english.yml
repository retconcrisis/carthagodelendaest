 #Character Appearances Events
 cde_character_appearances.1.t: "Gaius Marius"
 cde_character_appearances.1.desc: "A young citizen by the name of #Y Gaius Marius#! has entered Roman public life. Hailing from southern Latium, Marius has come to our attention due to a prominent official.\n\nDuring a dinner with Scipio Aemilianus in Hispania, when Scipio was asked where the people of Rome could find a worthy sucessor, Aemilianus pointed to the young Marius and stated that perhaps he was the man in question. Gaining the attention of a prominent Roman figure at such an early stage in his career, one can expect a promising future from this Gaius Marius."
 cde_character_appearances.1.a: "If we should listen to any man, it would be Aemilianus."
 cde_character_appearances.1.tt: "The character #Y Gaius Marius#! appears in Rome, aligned with the Populares"
 cde_character_appearances.2.t: "Unlikely Talent from a Fallen Gens"
 cde_character_appearances.2.desc: "A promising man by the name of #Y Lucius Cornelius Sulla#! has recently risen the cursus honorum and established himself a reputation as a talented individual. Though originating from the great gens Cornelii, Sulla's branch of the gens was a fallen family due to the banishment of his ancestor Publius Cornelius Rufinus for corruption. As a result, Sulla grew up poor and spent his youth among actors, comedians, musicians and dancers, with Sulla himself a singer and playwright.\n\nSome time later, he attained enough wealth to ascend the cursus honorum due to inheritances he received. Though he has now become a fairly prominent optimate, he continues to enjoy the company of actresses, musicians and dancers. Besides his craftiness, Sulla seems to also possess an extraordinarily bright military mind, although we have yet to see his talents in action."
 cde_character_appearances.2.a: "We shall watch this man's career with great interest."
 cde_character_appearances.2.tt: "The optimate character #Y Lucius Cornelius Sulla#! appears in Rome"
 cde_character_appearances.3.t: "Birth of Tigranes"
 cde_character_appearances.3.desc: "Another child has been born into the great family of the Artaxiads. Named #Y Tigranes#! by his father, the boy was born from the union of an Artaxiad and an Alani princess, who was received by his father as a consort from the Alani king of a great trading kingdom to the north. On the night of his birth, a bright star shot across the sky, illuminating every last corner of our realm in a way not seen by our people for centuries. Thus, our priests have interpreted this as quite a fortunate omen for the future of this child."
 cde_character_appearances.3.a: "Let us hope the omen is not a mere coincidence"
 cde_character_appearances.3.tt: "The boy #Y Tigranes#! is born in the Armenian capital to an #Y Alani princess#!, who also officially joins the court"
 
 #Starting Description Events
 cde_starting_events.1.t: "The Roman Republic"
 cde_starting_events.1.desc: "After decades of warfare, the Roman Republic has achieved unprecedented territorial expansion in the western Mediterranean. Roman armies continue to push deeper into Hispania and Illyria, and our influence in the Greek sphere grows by the day. Despite all of Rome's successes, however, our position is not yet secure. Almost two decades ago, the Republic had crushed the kingdom of Macedonia in the Third Macedonian War. Although the kingdom was dismantled and split into four client republics, a pretender by the name of Andriscus has rebelled in Macedonia, claiming to be an Antigonid and a son of the defeated king Perseus of Macedon.\n\nTo our south, the former empire of Carthage has finally recovered from their defeat in the Second Punic War, having paid off all of its debts just one year ago. Although limited in its ability to declare war due to the treaty from the previous war, Carthage has begun to rebuild its armies and infrastructure, which has become a cause for worry for Romans in the Senate. As a result, a pro-war faction has emerged calling for its destruction - Carthago Delenda Est!"
 cde_starting_events.1.a: "Let us see what the gods have planned for the sons and daughters of Aeneas."
 cde_starting_events.2.t: "Client Republics of Macedonia"
 cde_starting_events.2.desc: "Almost two decades ago, the Roman Republic invaded our homeland of Macedonia and defeated the Antigonid Kingdom of Macedonia. Dismantling the monarchy and dividing the kingdom into four client republics, the Romans have brought peace to the region at the cost of Macedonian unity. Furthermore, the Romans have since earned our ire through imposing numerous restrictions on the Macedonians, and many Macedonians despise the fact that they are divided. Although the common people are quite anti-Roman, the Macedonian nobility who have benefitted most from Roman hegemony favor Roman rule.\n\nHowever, a young man named Andriskos claims to be the son of Perseus, the last king of Macedonia. Although he was captured by the Seleukids and turned over to the Romans, Andriscus has since fled from Rome and has sought refuge under the Odrysians in Thrace. Only the gods can know what such an ambitious pretender has planned..."
 cde_starting_events.2.a: "Macedonia shall prosper under the republic!"
 cde_starting_events.3.t: "Kingdom of the Yavanas"
 cde_starting_events.3.desc: "Over a decade ago, the Indo-Greek kingdom was fragmented into several rival kingdoms, and all but one of the Indo-Greek rulers were defeated by Eukratides Diodotid of Greco-Bactria. However, the last independent Indo-Greek king, Menandros of the Euthydemids, has since pushed Eukratides back into Bactria, and has even expanded Indo-Greek influence further east towards the heartland of India, gaining tribute from Mathura and Saurashtra. The Shunga Empire in northern India now poses the greatest threat to us, its ruler Pushyamitra having overthrown the last Mauryan emperor decades ago.\n\nYet our ambitions do not end here. Having conquered more tribes in India than Alexander the Great himself, Menandros shall bravely lead our armies deep into the heartland of India, far beyond where Alexander's own armies had turned back from in fear."
 cde_starting_events.3.a: "We shall finish what Alexander started!"
 cde_starting_events.4.t: "Greco-Bactrian Kingdom"
 cde_starting_events.4.desc: "Many years ago, our basileus Eukratides the Great restored the Diodotid dynasty and united the Indo-Greek kingdoms under the rule of Greco-Bactria. However, faced by threats from all sides, we were defeated by the Parthians several years ago and lost much of our western Bactrian territories. Even worse, our campaign against Menandros of the Euthydemids proved disastrous; our armies were driven back to Bactria, and we lost control of the Indus entirely.\n\nStill, we have little time to lick our wounds, as the nomadic barbarians to the north continue to raid our territories and threaten the heartlands of Bactria itself. Though greatly weakened in strength, our armies and people must persevere; the century-old legacy of Greco-Bactria and Diodotus Soter will not end here!"
 cde_starting_events.4.a: "Greco-Bactria shall not fall!"
 cde_starting_events.5.t: "Carthage - An Empire Fighting For Survival"
 cde_starting_events.5.desc: "We Carthaginians were once the greatest imperial power in the western Mediterranean. However, our empire has been greatly diminished by the detestable Romans. Even worse, after our war with the Romans, many of our coastal territories were wrongfully seized by the Numidian king Masinissa, to such an extent that we are now flanked by the Numidians on all sides; we had even suffered a humiliating defeat at the hands of Masinissa just last year. Despite these setbacks, we recently paid off all war reparations owed to Rome, and we have begun rebuilding our economic and military strength.\n\nHowever, one stipulation that was included in our treaty with Rome following the last war with the Romans is that Carthage shall not declare any wars without Roman permission. Of course, it is unlikely that the Romans would ever grant us permission to do so. And with Rome being such an enormous power, we must tread carefully, even if our Carthaginian hearts burn for the reclamation of our lost land."
 cde_starting_events.5.a: "Let us restore the glory of our great city!"
 cde_starting_events.5.tt: "#R Carthage CANNOT declare OFFENSIVE wars, or else Rome will intervene#! - Rome will not intervene in defensive wars"
 cde_starting_events.6.t: "The Kingdom of the Numidians"
 cde_starting_events.6.desc: "King Masinissa is the first king of a united Numidian monarchy; having sided with Rome during the Second Punic War, Masinissa was king of the Massyli tribe. With the defeat of Carthage, Masinissa also defeated his rival, King Syphax of the Massaesylii, and united all of the Numidian tribes under a single banner. Masinissa himself did not wish to be a tribal chieftain, but a true king, with settled subjects, a proper army and a fleet financed by taxes rather than by irregular erratic tribal contributions.\n\nSince the end of the Second Punic War, Numidia continually encroached upon and seized Carthaginian lands; now, Numidia flanks Carthage by land on all sides. Furthermore, one of the terms of the Second Punic War's peace treaty was that Carthage would not be able to declare war without Roman permission - doing so would cause Rome itself to intervene and war against Carthage for violating the treaty. Thus, we can use this to our advantage; should we provoke the Carthaginians to war, the Carthaginians would have to fight a war on two fronts!"
 cde_starting_events.6.a: "Glory to Masinissa! Glory to Numidia!"
 cde_starting_events.6.tt: "#R If Carthage declares an offensive war, Rome will declare war on them#! - Rome will not intervene in Carthage's defensive wars"
 cde_starting_events.7.t: "A New King of Kings in Parthia"
 cde_starting_events.7.desc: "Around a century ago, the Parthians rebelled against Seleukid rule and established an independent monarchy under the Arsacid founder, #Y Arsaces I#!. Now, Parthia is led by #Y Mithridates the Great#!, who has greatly expanded the Parthian kingdom into a regional empire at the expense of the Seleukid and Bactrian kingdoms, having recently defeated the Seleukid satrap of Carmania as well as the Bactrian king Eukratides in Margiana. The Seleukids have lost their grip on their eastern territories, with the satrapy of #Y Media#! as well as the former Seleukid subjects of #Y Atropatene#! and #Y Persis#! left to fend for themselves while the Seleukids are occupied with a civil war. Additionally, Mithridates has become the first Parthian ruler to claim the prestigious Achaemenid title of 'King of Kings.' Thus, the future looks bright for the rising Parthian kingdom."
 cde_starting_events.7.a: "May we expand into a great empire!"
 cde_starting_events.8.t: "The Maccabees of Judea"
 cde_starting_events.8.desc: "Over a decade ago, the Jewish rebel warriors known as the #Y Maccabees#! led a revolution against the Seleukid dynasty; the Seleukids had attempted to Hellenize the Second Temple of Jerusalem, a move seen as blasphemous by many Jews. First led by the late #Y Mattathias#!, his sons took charge of the guerilla war against the Seleukids after his death. After the death of most of the sons of Mattathias at the hands of the Seleukids, #Y Jonathan Apphus#! and #Y Simon Thassi#! are the only two Maccabee brothers remaining.\n\nHowever, the Seleukids have now become embroiled in a civil war, allowing the Maccabees an opportunity to be recognized as a legitimate state. Making himself High Priest of Judea and establishing the #Y Hasmonean#! dynasty of Judea, #Y Jonathan Apphus#! now seeks to use his diplomatic abilities to seek allies in the rebel #Y Seleukid Claimant#! and other powerful kingdoms so Judea may survive the chaos in the Levant."
 cde_starting_events.8.a: "May God guide us on the path to peace and freedom!"
 
 
 #Country rename and Character rename events
 cde_country_rename.1.t: "The Proper Name of an Empire"
 cde_country_rename.1.desc: "When the Shunga dynasty seized the throne in Magadha from the Maurya many years ago, the empire was declared to be officially under the namesake of the Shunga rather than the Maurya. Now that the Shunga dynasty no longer rules the throne, so too shall their name be removed from the empire's namesake, as did the Maurya and Nanda dynasties before them. Thus, the empire shall be named after Magadha, the place from which our legacy began."
 cde_country_rename.1.a: "Long live the Magadha Empire!"
 cde_country_rename.2.t: "The End of Seleukid Rule"
 cde_country_rename.2.desc: "After over a century of rule, the Seleukid rule over Syria has come to an end. Thus, the time has come to fight under a new banner separate from the Seleukid identity. No longer the Seleukid Kingdom, we are now the kingdom of Syria."
 cde_country_rename.2.a: "Though the Seleukids are gone, Syria shall live on without them."
 cde_country_rename.3.t: "The End of Ptolemaic Rule"
 cde_country_rename.3.desc: "Though the land of Egypt has been synonymous with the Ptolemaic Kingdom for generations, today marks the day in which this is no longer the case. With the end to Ptolemaic rule in Egypt, our people shall live, serve and fight under not the Ptolemies, but instead a united Egyptian standard."
 cde_country_rename.3.a: "Egypt's legacy shall live on!"
 cde_country_rename.4.t: "The Next Ptolemaios"
 cde_country_rename.4.desc: "As per tradition, every male ruler of our dynasty shall adopt the name of our ancestor and great founder, Ptolemaios Soter. Though Ptolemaios Soter and all of the kings of the Ptolemaic line before us have ascended to live among the gods, we shall continue to carry on their legacy and glory though this tradition."
