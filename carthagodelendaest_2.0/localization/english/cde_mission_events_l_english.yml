 cde_me_igr_01.3.t: "The Middle Country"
 cde_me_igr_01.3.desc: "Having subjugated the Middle Country, including the city of Madhyamika, we have now secured a foothold and placed our troops practically halfway on the road to Magadha. Besides our strategic positioning, we have obtained other benefits as well.\n\nMadhyamika, the Middle Country, is home to elegant yet mighty elephants. Thanks to acquiring the region for ourselves, we can now turn our attention to picking out the finest of elephants from the best elephant breeders."
 cde_me_igr_01.3.a: "With each step, we grow ever closer to the Magadhan heartland"
 cde_me_igr_01.4.t: "The Mighty Yaudheyas"
 cde_me_igr_01.4.desc: "The militant Yaudheyas were formidable warriors under the Mauryan Empire; they were so respected as warriors and generals that their chief served as the Mahasenapati, or 'Great Commander,' of the Mauryans.\n\nThus, now that they have been subjugated by our own military might, the Yaudheyans have no choice but to swear allegiance to our basileus. Furthermore, we have chosen a skilled Yaudheyan commander to offer their knowledge and skills by serving as an officer and military advisor to our basileus."
 cde_me_igr_01.4.a: "We shall make the best of the might of the Yaudheyas"
 cde_me_igr_01.4.tt: "A #Y Yaudheyan military advisor#! joins the court"
 cde_me_igr_01.5.t: "Fields of Herakles-Balarama"
 cde_me_igr_01.5.desc: "The Greek historian Megasthenes recorded a century ago that the Indian peoples of Shaurasena worshipped Herakles. Although it seems that this is not truly the case, and that they instead worship the similar god in Hinduism known as Balarama, the elder brother of Krishna, our subjects have gone on to claiming the lands of Shaurasena for the god Herakles, which has resulted in a syncretic deity of Herakles-Balarama, worshipped by Greeks and Hindus alike.\n\nFuthermore, in Greco-Buddhist culture, the bodhisattva Vajrapani is depicted as Herakles, making Herakles also the protector of the Buddha. This blending of Hindu, Greek and Buddhist culture has allowed for greater syncretism between followers of the three faiths."
 cde_me_igr_01.5.a: "Whatever unites our subjects is always a welcome change"
 cde_me_igr_01.8.t: "Avengers of the Mauryans"
 cde_me_igr_01.8.desc: "After much struggle and many bloody wars, we Indo-Greeks have finally seized the great city of Pataliputra. Since our ruling dynasty have finally conquered the former Mauryan capital of Pataliputra, we have finally avenged our former friends the Mauryans by vanquishing the pretenders who had treacherously seized their throne. Thus, we have also inherited the Mauryan's legacy of ruling a huge realm of many cultures. Looking upon our ruler now not as a foreign 'Yavana' (Greek) ruler but instead as the rightful Lord of the Magadhan Empire, our subjects shall surely be more secure in where their loyalties lie, lest they defy even the gods and the heavens themselves."
 cde_me_igr_01.8.a: "Another one of many titles for our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] - the 'Lord of Magadha'!"
 cde_me_igr_01.9.t: "Poleis in India"
 cde_me_igr_01.9.desc: "The Hellenistic kingdoms and diadochi that rose in the aftermath of Alexander the Great's death were successful in establishing poleis, Greek-style cities, across their respective realms, encompassing lands in which no Greek had ruled before. Thus, as our empire expanded further into India, we established Greek poleis of our own, far from the Greek poleis of Bactria and Gandhara.\n\n"
 cde_me_igr_01.9.a: "Let us build gymnasiums for all non-Greek subjects who wish to integrate into the Greek culture"
 cde_me_igr_01.9.tt: "Every province that meets the mission requirements gains the modifier #Y Gymnasium#! for 10 years\n\n"
 cde_me_igr_01.10.t: "Uttarapatha Trade"
 cde_me_igr_01.10.desc: "By seizing the rich lands of Pancala, our kingdom has seized several trading cities vital to the Uttarapatha, the 'northern road' of India. Home to trade routes for centuries from Taxila to the west all the way to Pataliputra in the east, our increased control of these valuable trade routes has allowed us to profit more from commerce in northern India through taxes, tolls and tariffs."
 cde_me_igr_01.10.a: "To think that this is only but a fraction of the vast riches India has to offer!"
 cde_me_igr_01.11.t: "Kingdom of Heaven"
 cde_me_igr_01.11.desc: "The city of Ayodhya, also known as the Place Where Heaven Resides; the birthplace of Rama; the abode of Vishnu. Capturing this city is of great strategic and religious significance to our kingdom. As the defenders of the city of Heaven itself, our state has become a kingdom of the Heavens - and thus our ruler a defender and guardian of Heaven's door itself."
 cde_me_igr_01.11.a: "Let us prove our loyalty to the Heavens!"
 cde_me_igr_01.12.t: "Herakles, Protector of the Buddha"
 cde_me_igr_01.12.desc: "Our armies had marched from Gandhara to Magadha and had taken the great city of Pataliputra, the former capital of the Mauryan Empire. In a display to all of our tolerance and patronage of the Buddhist religion, we have fulfilled our prophecy of construction a great stupa in the city of Pataliputra itself. Many Buddhists across the former Shunga realm now rejoice at the signaled end of Buddhist persecution, and we have become the undisputed guardians of the Buddhist faith in northern India.\n\nIn Indo-Greek and Greco-Buddhism culture, the bodhisattva #Y Vajrapani#! was depicted as #Y Herakles#!, and was made the Protector of the Buddha. Therefore, our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] #Y [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]#! has been likened to Herackles and Vajrapani himself, greatly increasing the prestige of our ruler among Buddhists, Buddhist-symphathizers and Greeks alike."
 cde_me_igr_01.12.a: "Long live [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPraenomen], the spear of Herakles and Vajrapani!"
 cde_me_igr_01.13.t: "Temple to Athena Alkidemos in Pataliputra"
 cde_me_igr_01.13.desc: "After some time, our temple dedicated to Athena Alkidemos in Pataliputra has been completed at last. A dazzling structure of marble, the Temple of Athena Alkidemos in the East stands as a symbol of our piety to the gods, as well as a monument to the many Greek and Indian lives that were lost in our endeavor to unite east and west under the blessing of the gods."
 cde_me_igr_01.13.a: "Glory to Athena! Glory to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPraenomen]!"
 cde_me_igr_01.14.t: "Hellenic Additions to Sanchi Stupa"
 cde_me_igr_01.14.desc: "The Great Stupa in Sanchi began construction under the illustrious emperor Ashoka the Great of Maurya as a symbol of his newfound conversion and dedication to the Buddhist religion. Continuing the legacy of Ashoka as a benevolent patron of Buddhism, we have renovated and expanded upon the Great Stupa. In addition to expanding the Great Stupa itself, we have also added our own Hellenic cultural flair, with Greek statues and decorations blending with the Buddhist Indian motifs of the original Ashokan stupa."
 cde_me_igr_01.14.a: "We are successors not only of Alexandros and Demetrios, but also of Ashoka!"
 cde_me_igr_01.15.t: "Bilingual Coinage"
 cde_me_igr_01.15.desc: "After consuliting our non-Greek officials throughout our realm, we have established several centers for minting coins with bilingual script. Since the coins include both Greek script as well as the local scripts of various regions across our realm, our state has been brought closer to our non-Greek subjects than ever before, making integration and assimilation more feasible than before as well."
 cde_me_igr_01.15.a: "We are 'Indo-Greeks' both in name and in practice!"
 cde_me_igr_01.17.t: "Savior of the Greeks of India"
 cde_me_igr_01.17.desc: "Following the fall of the relatively philhellene Mauryan Empire, the safety and future of Greeks in India was unsure. Fortunately, our basileus came to protect these Greek communities in India, acting as a steadfast and sturdy shield in the face of chaos and mindless warfare. As if in complete accord with our patron deity, Athena Alkidemos (Alkidemos meaning 'Savior of the People'), our basileus [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPraenomen] has become a savior of the Greeks. Thus, Greek communities across our kingdom shall certainly be grateful of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPraenomen]'s protection while they go about their daily lives in peace."
 cde_me_igr_01.17.a: "Adopt the prestigious Greek epithet of 'Savior'"
 cde_me_igr_01.17.b: "Adopt the 'Savior' epithet, but in the Indian Pali language"
 cde_me_igr_01.17.c: "Our basileus needs no such epithets"
 cde_me_igr_01.17.tt: "#Y No new nickname is adopted#!"
 cde_me_igr_01.18.t: "Heir of Alexander"
 cde_me_igr_01.18.desc: "Our kingdom has conquered more peoples and pushed farther into India than even the great Alexander. We have sacked the great city and former Mauryan capital of Pataliputra, something none of our predecessors who claimed to be diadochi were able to achieve. We etch these words on monuments across the kingdom not to undermine the achievements of Alexander and the diadochi, but instead to celebrate the continuation of their legacy. Whereas Alexander had brought about the union of Greek and Persian culture, our empire now unites the cultures and peoples of Greece and India, bridging the western and eastern realms at last.\n\nThus, just as Alexander had declared himself the Lord of Asia, we have the unique opportunity to declare ourselves as the Lord of India itself."
 cde_me_igr_01.18.a: "Declare a new empire of India!"
 
 #Laconia / Sparta
 cde_me_spa_01.1.t: "Debate for Laconian Resistance"
 cde_me_spa_01.1.desc: "Since the subjugation of Sparta and the Laconian cities by the Achaean League, we Laconians have never been truly loyal to the Achaeans. A dispute over some territory with the Achaean League has quickly escalated into a question of our loyalty to the League itself. Although the oligarchs are quite split on this topic, it seems that the common people of Laconia are fully prepared to revolt against Achaean hegemony at any moment.\n\nThus, several prominent pro-independence Laconians, including some delegates from Sparta itself, have brought the debate to the acropoleis of Laconia."
 cde_me_spa_01.1.a: "The fate of Laconia shall be decided..."
 cde_me_spa_01.1.tt: "The Laconian assembly debates the question of attempting to break away from the Achaean League"
 cde_me_spa_01.2.t: "Defiance Against the Achaeans!"
 cde_me_spa_01.2.desc: "After much debate, the majority of the Laconian oligarchs have voted in favor of opposing Achaean rule, aligning with the cry for independence of the common people."
 cde_me_spa_01.2.a: "Laconia must be chained down no longer!"
 cde_me_spa_01.3.t: "Dispute Over Rightful Laconian Territory"
 cde_me_spa_01.3.desc: "A dispute over territory has recently sparked heated debate between the Achaean council and us Laconians. Although the territory disputed itself is relatively small compared to the former sphere of influence of Sparta, the dispute has brought to the forefront questions of Achaean oppression of our people. Though we were admitted into the League supposedly as equals of the Achaeans, their aggressiveness towards us Laconians since our league membership has made clear to us all our true status as second-class citizens.\n\nThus, the Laconian people, nobles and freemen alike, have chosen to press our claims in the hopes of gaining attention from overseas in Rome."
 cde_me_spa_01.3.a: "First, we must fight for our rightful land - only then can we fight for our freedom!"
 cde_me_spa_01.4.t: "A Delegate to Rome"
 cde_me_spa_01.4.desc: "Our delegate to Rome has been met with success! Besides our generous offering of gold and other valuable items, we have also gained the support of Menalkides of Sparta. Although he was once strategos of the Achaean League, it is a pleasure to see that his loyalties still lie with his homeland.\n\nThus, all that is left now is ensuring that the Laconian people are unanimously in agreement of independence so the Romans may confidently support us."
 cde_me_spa_01.4.a: "May Rome be blessed by the gods - and may the Achaeans be cursed by them"
 cde_me_spa_01.5.t: "Pro-Independence Faction Secured"
 cde_me_spa_01.5.desc: "By gaining the loyalty and backing from members of the most prominent oligarch families in Laconia, we have boosted the influence of the pro-independence movement in Laconia. For the first time in over a generation, we are finally starting to see the martial pride that our forefathers once possessed in the times of Laconian dominance over the Peloponnesus."
 cde_me_spa_01.5.a: "Nobles and freemen alike, united under one banner!"
 cde_me_spa_01.6.t: "Friends in Achaea"
 cde_me_spa_01.6.desc: "There have been Achaean oligarchs who sympathized with our griveances in the past, including the former strategos Menalkides of Sparta. Through both questionable and sincere means, we Laconians have acquired the friendship, and therefore the sympathy, of some high-profile, office-holding Achaeans in the very same League that we Laconians have grown to despise.\n\nOur new Achaean friends have even been so generous as to acquire funds from the Achaean treasury - through absolutely questionable means - to fund our noble cause!"
 cde_me_spa_01.6.a: "Embezzlement is morally correct if it is for a good cause... right?"
 cde_me_spa_01.7.t: "Purge of Achaean Sympathizers"
 cde_me_spa_01.7.desc: "The dominance of the pro-independence faction has allowed for us to make bolder moves against dissidents against our noble cause. Thus, the pro-independence oligarchs have recorded and targeted the least loyal of the great families and placed them behind bars through relatively speedy trials.\n\nThe purging of Achaean sympathizers has won our ruler's popularity among the pro-independence public in Laconia. At the same time, such a bold move has caused some of the oligarchs who were more neutrally-aligned to feel... quite uncomfortable."
 cde_me_spa_01.7.a: "The oligarchs are either with us or against us!"
 cde_me_spa_01.8.t: "Laconian Declares Independence!"
 cde_me_spa_01.8.desc: "Having despised Achaean hergemony since they were first subjugated by the #Y Achaean League#! in the Laconian War, the #Y Laconians#! have rallied against Achaean rule once more and declared a war for independence against their overlords.\n\nDue to the #Y Roman Republic#! having ties with both the Achaean League and the Laconians, Roman intervention in this war is likely if has not been settled in a couple of months time..."
 cde_me_spa_01.8.a: "War resumes once more in Greece..."
 cde_me_spa_01.9.t: "Demands to End Achaean Aggression"
 cde_me_spa_01.9.desc: "After much debate in the Senate regarding the war between the #Y Achaeans#! and the #Y Laconians#!, several pro-intervention senators have drafted a list of demands for the Achaeans: the release of Laconia as an independent state; the cease of all hostilities between Achaeans and Laconians; and the freedom of several other city-states as punishment for the Achaean League's mismanagement of its subjects.\n\nAlthough we would surely be able to enforce these demands, the Achaeans may likely not accept - thus, it is up to us if we wish to deal with one more headache in the Mediterranean."
 cde_me_spa_01.9.a: "This is our chance to put the Achaeans in their place"
 cde_me_spa_01.9.b: "This war is none of our business"

 cde_me_spa_01.10.t: "Rome Demands Laconian Independence!"
 cde_me_spa_01.10.desc: "While the Laconians have revolted against the rule of the Achaean League, it seems we have drawn the attention of a much bigger threat. The Roman Republic, having witnessed the anger of the Laconians, as well as having received Laconian diplomats in Rome, have decided to side with the Laconians against us.\n\nCiting that we do not have the authority to decide on matters of life and death regarding the Laconians, the Romans demand that we not only #Y release Laconia#!, but also release #Y Elis, Argos, Messenia and Corinth#! and their additional historical territories as punishment.\n\nAccepting these demands would deal a massive blow to our power and influence in Greece; at the same time, refusing these terms would mean war with the Romans which, in all honesty, may be akin to suicide."
 cde_me_spa_01.10.a: "The Romans have no right to intervene on behalf of our subjects!"
 cde_me_spa_01.10.b: "We must give in to their demands..."
 cde_me_spa_01.10.tt: "#R Rome will join Laconia in their independence war against us#!"

 cde_me_spa_01.11.t: "Achaea Refuses Roman Demands!"
 cde_me_spa_01.11.desc: "The Achaeans have boldly, if not brazenly and incredibly foolishly, refused Roman demands for the liberation of Laconia and several other city-states as punishment for the Achaean's mismanagement of the Laconian situation. Thus, the Roman Republic shall wage a punitive war upon the Achaeans - if we have learned anything in the past century, it is that no power stands up to Rome without regretting it!"
 cde_me_spa_01.11.a: "The Achaeans must be suicidal!"
 cde_me_spa_01.12.t: "Achaea Gives in to Roman Demands!"
 cde_me_spa_01.12.desc: "The Achaean League has wisely decided to accept Roman demands to free Laconia as well as several other city-states as punishment for their mismanagement of the situation with the Laconian independence movement. It seems that while they have avoided war with Rome through submission, the Achaeans have lost most of their power and influence in Greece as a result of giving in to the demands."

 cde_me_mac_01.1.desc: "The Odrysian king #Y Teres III#! and his Odrysian chieftains had supported Andriskos, giving him Odrysian troops to fight under the Antigonid banner as well as direct military support from some of the Odrysian chiefs themselves.\n\nBy continuing our friendly relations with the Odrysian king, we have received another gift: the loyalty of one of the Odrysian king's finest bodyguards, in exchange for continued goodwill with the Odrysian kingdom."

 cde_me_mac_01.2.t: "The Quashing of Republican Ideals"
 cde_me_mac_01.2.desc: "Following the Roman occupation of Macedonia, the plague of republicanism spread throughout our former kingdom. Now, the nobles and citizens, groups that benefit from the most from the shift to a republic, even continue to favor pro-republic ideals. Thus, by allying with one of the heads of the great families and cracking down on republicanism among our oligarchs and citizens, our ruler can now enact laws and imprison traitors (and would-be traitors) as they please."
 cde_me_mac_01.2.a: "Long live the basileus!"
 cde_me_mac_01.3.t: "Unification of Macedonia"
 cde_me_mac_01.3.desc: "At long last, Macedonians shall no longer fight fellow Macedonians; the client republics have been all reunited under the Antigonid monarchy, and the Macedonian people now rally under [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] to restore the old glory of Macedonia, which had shone brightly from the age of Philip II and Alexander the Great to the last years of Philip V and Perseus."
 cde_me_mac_01.3.a: "Glory to Macedonia! Glory to the Basileus!"

 cde_me_mac_01.5.t: "True Basileus of Macedonia"
 cde_me_mac_01.5.desc: "Before he gained the political and military backing to retake Pella, Andriskos wandered across Greece in search of support. He was given an audience with #Y Kallippa#! of Beroia, the former concubine of King #Y Perseus#! of Macedon, Andriskos' father. Kallippa had sympathized with the son of her late partner and given Andriskos funds, a regal costume and a royal diadem; Kallippa even referred Andriskos to the king of Thrace, from whom Andriskos would receive the military support to retake Pella.\n\nThus, with Macedonia secured under the Antigonids once more, Andriskos has now decided to officially crown himself as Basileus, king of all Macedonia, as well as adopt the regnal name of his forefathers as#Y  Philip VI#! of Macedonia!"
 cde_me_mac_01.5.a: "Long live Philip VI of Macedonia!"
 cde_me_mac_01.6.t: "Palace Restoration Begins"
 cde_me_mac_01.6.desc: "Following our third and last defeat by Rome, the Romans sacked our great city of Pella, plundering its treasures and treasury. Even so, the great foundations and strategic position of the capital city remain, and it has since seen some further restoration. Surrounded by defensible marshlands, its fortifications have served Macedonia well for centuries. Thus, let us restore the great royal palace in Pella where that of our forefathers had stood since the times of Philip II and Alexander the Great."

 cde_me_mac_01.8.t: "A New Breadbasket in Greece"
 cde_me_mac_01.8.desc: "The region of Thessaly to the south has sometimes been called the 'Breadbasket of Greece' thanks to its summer rains and mountain valleys. However, through the toiling work of the Macedonian people, we Macedonians have successfully grown a new breadbasket in Greece in the Macedonian homeland itself. These breadbaskets that shall feed our children in times of peace as well as our soldiers in times of war."

 cde_me_mac_01.9.desc: "King Philip V of Macedonia, the grandfather of Andriskos and one of the valiant kings who fought against the growing Roman menace, had designated the city of Kassandreia as the primary naval base. Thus, in order to prepare for the restoration of a great Macedonian fleet, we have expanded the city of Kassandreia to be both a great commercial center as well as expanded its shipyards so the city may once again serve as the main naval base of the Antigonid kingdom."

 cde_me_mac_01.10.t: "Grand Fleet of Macedonia"
 cde_me_mac_01.10.desc: "Though we were successful against the allies of Rome on land, our naval presence in the Aegean Sea has been lacking since our defeat by Rome in the Third Roman-Macedonian War. Thus, our finests shipmakers have worked together to construct the foundation for a grand fleet of Macedonia. While we have a long way to go before we can challenge the full might of the Roman fleet, we now have a grand fleet under a unified Macedonia that shall work to defend our shores."

 cde_me_mac_01.11.desc: "The noble families of Beroia had been especially close with past Antigonid rulers, such as King Perseus, father of Andriskos. Perseus' concubine Kallippa was even from the Hippostratoi-Kallippoi family; Kallippa herself had also greatly assisted Andriskos by giving him funds and referring him to the Odrysian king of Thrace when Andriskos had few followers to speak of. Our ties with specifically Macedonian-born nobles in Beroia have greatly improved our perception among Macedonian noble families in our kingdom."

 cde_me_mac_01.12.desc: "The Greek city of #Y Abdera#! along the Thracian coast is home to many riches, being a major port city between the lands of Macedonia, Thrace and Anatolia. Centuries ago, the city was even the third wealthiest city in the Delian League during the Peloponnesian War thanks to its trans-regional trade. However, this blessing may also be a curse, as the city's wealth has also made Abdera the favorite target for plundering by neighboring tribes and kingdoms alike. Thus, by placing Abdera under our protection, we have acquired greater access and control over the Thracian coastal trade, which Abdera itself controlled for centuries."

Although the Thessalians and Euboeans believed themselves to be in better hands when Rome granted them independence during the 384th Isthmian Games, they shall come to accept Macedonian hegemony once more, once they have accepted that Greek rule is preferable to non-Greek rule. Additionally, just as #Y Philip II#!, father of Alexander the Great, was elected as the official Archon of the Thessalian League, our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] #Y [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]#! has been elected as the archon and protector of the Thessalian and Euboean league cities."

 cde_me_mac_01.14.desc: "The cult of Zeus Eleutherios was established in Athens centuries ago. However, recently the Thessalians had adopted Zeus Eleutherios as their patron deity. Eleutherios meaning 'freedom,' the deity that first represented Greek independence from Persia after the Persian Wars was now adopted by the Thessalians to mean freedom from Macedonian rule. Since such symbolism is problematic for our restored rule over Thessaly, we have built a great temple dedicated to Zeus Eleutherios and have purposefully altered the meaning of 'freedom' to instead mean freedom of Greeks from non-Greek, Roman dominance."

However, they were defeated in the Third Roman-Macedonian War; their cities destroyed by the Romans, the Athamanians migrated away from their homeland near Thessaly shortly after, moving to Aetolia, Thessaly and Epirus in search of better lives.\n\nThus, we have established a new home for the Athamanians and have invited the Athamanian diaspora to resettle in our lands as a united Commonwealth of the Athamanians once more. Furthermore, the Athamanians are experts of warfare in their home among the mountain valleys, which shall certainly serve us well in our campaigns in the mountains of Greece and beyond."

 cde_me_mac_01.16.desc: "When Andriskos first rebelled against Roman rule in Macedonia, he did not have coins of his own. Thus, Andriskos' coinage was overstruck on top of existing Antigonid, Roman and Client Republic coinage. Now that we have established official mints to issue coinage of our own, other foreign powers now view us as a legitimate state instead of a group of rebels who could not even issue their own coins."

 cde_me_car_01.8.desc: "Though we have conquered the lands of the Numidians, including territories far from our capital of Carthage, directly ruling the inland territories of Numidia may be difficult for us. Thus, perhaps it would be better if the Numidians were granted autonomy as vassal states - at the same time, however, we must be sure to split the Numidians in two to prevent any further difficulties."
 cde_me_car_01.8.a: "Grant them autonomy as vassals and allies of Carthage"
 cde_me_car_01.8.b: "Only our former allies, the Massaesylii, deserve autonomy."
 cde_me_car_01.8.c: "Not having direct rule would be a mistake"
 cde_me_car_01.8.tt1: "Release #Y Massylia#! as a Feudatory, giving it all provinces with Massylian culture that are in the Numidia and Mauretania regions and are NOT coastal territories."

 cde_me_car_01.9.t: "Numidian Auxiliaries"
 cde_me_car_01.9.desc: "The Numidian cavalry were reknowned across the world as among the finest,if not the finest, light cavalry in all of the Mediterranean realm. Notably, they had served our Carthaginian forefathers as mercenaries and auxiliaries in their conquests. However, it all changed when Masinissa of the Massylii sided with the Romans in the Second Roman War and conquered the Carthaginian-allied Massaesylii. With the integration of the Numidians to ensure their loyalty, we now have permanent Numidian cavalry auxiliaries, as opposed to mercenaries with wavering loyalties."
 cde_me_car_01.9.a: "The famed Numidian cavalry fight for Carthage once more!"
 cde_me_car_01.10.t: "Coastal Trade Fleet"
 cde_me_car_01.10.desc: "With the reconquest of our trading cities in Mauretania, we now have the influence and strength to assemble a great trade fleet that shall protect our interests in the southern Mediterranean, challenging the merchants of Rome itself."
 cde_me_car_01.10.a: "May Carthage be ever prosperous!"
 cde_me_car_01.11.t: "Legacy of the Philaeni Brothers"
 cde_me_car_01.11.desc: "Long ago, the Carthaginians and Greek Cyrenaicans made peace and agreed to each send out envoys; they agreed that wherever the envoys happened to meet would mark the border between Carthaginians and Greeks. However, the Cyrenaicans left late from their homes - instead of accepting their mistake, the Cyrenaicans accused the Carthaginian envoys, the two Philaeni brothers, of leaving their homes early. The treacherous and deceptive Greeks demanded that the Carthaginian brothers would have to be buried alive on the spot to mark Carthage's boundaries. Thus, the honorable Philaeni brothers were buried alive in Arae Philaenorum, a land now named after the Philaeni brothers for giving their lives for their country.\n\nMuch like the Philaeni brothers, many of our own Carthaginian people gave their lives to ensure the restoration of Carthaginian glory; they could have laid down their arms and surrendered to the Romans and Numidians, and yet they continued to fight and die for our country. Thus, in their honor as well as in the honor of the Philaeni brothers, let us build a grand statue and stele in Arae Philaenorum, marking the expansion of our great empire from near destruction."
 cde_me_car_01.11.a: "Let us build a grand stele to honor them"
 cde_me_car_01.12.t: "Overseas Naval Bases"
 cde_me_car_01.12.desc: "With the conquest of the islands of the Balearides, we have established our first overseas naval base in the Mediterranean since our last defeat in the Second Roman War. Thus, we have projected our power beyond the African coast once more, reestablishing the naval powerhouse of Carthage once more."
 cde_me_car_01.12.a: "May Carthaginian ships rule the waves once more!"
 cde_me_car_01.13.t: "Carthage Rising"
 cde_me_car_01.13.desc: "We Carthaginians have risen from near-destruction following the Second Punic War. We have restored the empire of Carthage, inheriting the legacy of our forefathers while also winning glory of our own. Thus, rather than being seen as a declining power doomed to be destroyed, foreign states shall now view Carthage as a legitimate challenger to Roman hegemony over the Mediterranean."
 cde_me_car_01.13.a: "Glory to Carthage! May Carthage reign for one thousand years!"
 cde_me_car_01.14.t: "Fortifications of Carthage"
 cde_me_car_01.14.desc: "The walls of Carthage have never been sturdier. Although the Romans have bested us in two wars now, we are now prepared for a direct Roman assault on Carthaginian home soil. Uniting the Carthaginian people towards a common cause - survival - we have made our city walls as well as our armies immovable in the face of danger."
 cde_me_car_01.14.a: "Carthage shall survive and thrive in this era of chaos!"
 cde_me_car_01.15.t: "Restoration of the Grand Fleet"
 cde_me_car_01.15.desc: "Since we finished paying all of our reparations to Rome around half a century after our defeat in the Second Roman War, we had been secretly building up our naval strength for both war and trade. Thus, with our grand fleet restored to some semblance of its former glory, we can now defend ourselves from the sea as well as on land.\n\nAdditionally, while our land armies are mostly made up of mercenaries and private armies, our sailors are recruited from the lower classes. With the expansion of the navy, many of our common people now have job stability thanks to their service in our fleet."
 cde_me_car_01.15.a: "The seas shall belong to Carthage once more!"
 cde_me_car_01.16.t: "Noble Armies"
 cde_me_car_01.16.desc: "Traditionally, our suffetes do not lead our armies into battle. Instead, following the reforms of Hamilcar Barca, nobles were allowed to maintain their own private armies. This meant that much of the army was paid for by the nobility, significantly cutting costs. Though we had been forced to rely on general conscripts after our humiliating defeat in the Second Roman War, we have restored our great army, including the soldiers provided by the noble families; since the nobles provide their own arms, this makes raising troops take less of a toll on our coffers."
 cde_me_car_01.16.a: "The seas shall belong to Carthage once more!"
 cde_me_car_01.17.t: "Sacred Band of Carthage"
 cde_me_car_01.17.desc: "The Sacred Band of Thebes was a fearsome fighting force in Greece, made up of 150 pairs of lovers in the Theban army. However, the sacred band was defeated by Philip II of Macedon. In emulation of this famed band, Carthage created its own Sacred Band of around 3,000 infantry soldiers, known for carrying white shields and using Greek phalanx equipment and tactics. While the Sacred Band of Carthage was disbanded after the Second Roman War, our new successes and martial might have given us the opportunity to reestablish this prestigious unit."
 cde_me_car_01.17.a: "May they bring glory to Carthage!"
 cde_me_car_01.18.t: "Much-Needed Military Reforms"
 cde_me_car_01.18.desc: "We have always been very strict with our generals, even executing them through crucifixion if they performed especially poorly. Now that we have opened up recruitment to the common freemen of our realm, we can now conduct a greater search for hidden talent among freemen veterans alike to find generals who are guaranteed to lead us to victory - after all, desperate times call for desperate measures\n\nAfter some searching, we have discovered three inviduals of relatively lower status who have performed well in our past campaigns: a #Y Carthaginian#! freeman soldier of lower rank, a #Y Numidian#! auxiliary cavalryman, and a #Y Garamantian#! mercenary captain."
 cde_me_car_01.18.a: "The Carthaginian freeman shall lead his former comrades"

 cde_me_car_01.19.desc: "Even during the height of the Carthaginian empire's power, our Libyan auxiliaries were the most disciplined auxiliaries despite being mostly light infantry. With the restoration of our former borders in Libyan lands, we have reacquired the service of these renowned Libyan warriors."
 cde_me_car_01.19.a: "May they win us many victories!"
 cde_me_car_01.20.t: "North African War Elephants"
 cde_me_car_01.20.desc: "We have begun breeding North African elephants once more - the same war elephants that struck fear into the hearts of all Romans when Hannibal crossed the Alps into Italy itself. As the Hellenistic empires once known for their formidable war elephants fall into decline, like the Seleukids and the Ptolemies in the east, Carthage shall reemerge as the power with the greatest war elephant armies in the Mediterranean."

 cde_me_rom_01.1.desc: "Since we decisively defeated the Carthaginian menace at the conclusion of the Second Punic War, the city of Carthage and its subjects are not much of a threat to Roman hegemony over the Mediterranean. With Carthage rebuilding their forces and having recently paid off their debt from the war over half a century ago, the question of how exactly to deal with Carthage has come to the Senate floor once more."
 cde_me_rom_01.1.a: "Should Carthage stand or fall?"
 cde_me_rom_01.2.t: "The Carthaginian Answer"
 cde_me_rom_01.2.desc: "After much debate between those who wish to destroy Carthage entirely, those who wish to leave Carthage be as a common enemy that Romans can unite against and therefore prevent unrest, and those who have moderate opinions of the topic, the time has come for the Senate to make a decision. After hearing of increased anti-Carthaginian fervor among the senators, including the vocal #Y Cato the Censor#!, who ends all of his speeches with a call to destroy Carthage, the concerned Carthaginians have sent envoys to Rome in hopes of finding a diplomatic solution to our rivalry."

 cde_me_rom_01.3.desc: "The Numidian king #Y Masinissa#! was a valuable ally to Rome during the #Y Second Punic War#!. It is true that both Rome and Numidia wish to expand into former Carthaginian territory, as King Masinissa himself as seized the entire coast of Tripolitania from the Carthaginians since the end of the Second Punic War. Even so, by reestablishing our close friendship with the Numidian throne in Cirta, we have regained the trust of the Numidians and established a temporary non-aggression pact with the ruler of Numidia between our two states so we do not end up fighting over the territory of our own common enemy."

 cde_me_rom_01.4.t: "Carthage Must Be Destroyed!"
 cde_me_rom_01.4.desc: "The well-respected Cato the Censor ended all of his speeches with the phrase 'Furthermore, I believe Carthage must be destroyed,' regardless of whether or not the speech itself had anything to do with Carthage. While the Second Punic War is now over a half-century old, the deaths of the war have not left the cultural memory of the Roman people. Thus, with many calling for the destruction of our Carthaginians rivals, the time has finally come to plan for the demise of the arrogant and vile Carthaginians!"
