  roman_republic_heritage_desc:0 "Born where the Greek south meets the Etruscan north, Rome has since seen unprecedented expansion in the Mediterranean during the past century. As a result, our influence has been spread far beyond the already-expansive borders of our empire.

  etruscan_socii_heritage_desc:0 "Our ancestors once were dominant rulers of northern Italia. However, the Romans have since conquered all of the Etruscan people, and we have been made socii of their state. Still, the legacy of the Etruscans shines through despite our subjugation; having influenced Rome since its inception, Etruscan culture continues to be seen in Roman culture; several patrician families in Rome are even of Etruscan origin."

  samnite_socii_heritage_desc:0 "The Samnite people were descended from the Sabines, and through Ver Sacrum we were guided by a sacred bull sent by Mamers, the god of war, that brought our ancestors to our homeland of today. Our forefathers once ruled over a mighty confederation that waged several fierce wars against the Romans, but they ultimately were compelled to surrender. Nonetheless, the Samnite people continue to clutch to our heritage and culture and resist Latinization, as well as Roman authority itself."

As the last of the true classical Greek leagues, and the most successful of them all in achieving equality between its member states, the Achaean League must continue to shine as a beacon of democracy surrounded by tyrants and kings."

  laconian_heritage_desc:0 "The cities of Laconia were ruled by the Spartans for centuries. However, since the times of Epaminondas of Thebes, Sparta gradually lost control of the region, and was fully subjugated by the Achaean League less than half a century ago. Since then, although we have been freed by the Spartan monarchy's yoke, our relations with our new Achaean superiors have been anything but smooth. Despite our weakened state, we are still renowned for our legacy as warriors as the sons and daughters of King Lacedaemon."

Thus, our city holds riches that are the envy and desire of every polity around us; this means we must also be wary of any who wish to take these riches from us."

Although we have left our nomadic ways behind, we continue to be a fearsome force on horseback, just as our Scythian forefathers had been when they dominated the steppe countless generations ago."

Despite having been partially assimilated into the Scythian culture, we continue to pride ourselves in distinctly-Tauri traditions. Living by plunder and war, we also strike fear into our enemies by sacrificing anyone who dares trespass our lands to our Virgin Goddess."

  parthian_empire_heritage_desc:0 "Famed for their hit-and-run tactics with mounted archers, the Parthians have torn across Persia with their world-class cavalry, devastating the Seleukid Kingdom in the west. This military might has allowed for rapid expansion under Mithridates the Great that has quickly turned Parthia into an empire that blends Parthian culture with that of the Greeks and Persians. Many non-Parthian subjects also tolerate their new rulers, since they are mostly given autonomy, as the Parthians were more concerned with geographical expansion than cultural conquest."
  persian_frataraka_heritage:0 "Frataraka Heritage"
  persian_frataraka_heritage_desc:0 "Known as Governors of the Gods, the Frataraka have governed the region of Persis, home to the Achaemenid heritage, for many generations. As the power of the Seleukids over the eastern satrapies wanes, the governors of Persis have since exerted greater autonomy. Though later made a subject kingdom of the Parthians, Persis under Ardashir of the Sassanid dynasty would overthrow the Parthians and establish the Sasanian Empire, a direct and truly Persian successor to the Achaemenids."

Though we once fought the Seleukid forces while hiding among the trees, we have now secured the land of Judah and the Temple itself as the official rulers of the land. We shall continue to fight to uphold the Law in accordance with the words of Mattathias: be devoted to the Law and ready to die to defend God's covenant with our ancestors."

  elymais_heritage:0 "Elymaean Heritage"
  elymais_heritage_desc:0 "The civilization of Elam dates back over three thousand years, and we Elamites have continued the martial legacy of our forefathers as skilled archers, as our mounter archers were so fearsome that the Seleukid kings called on our warriors to aid them in their campaigns. Elam is also known for its great golden temples, which the Seleukid kings had treacherously attempted to plunder on numerous occasions, though without success - we had even slain the supposedly 'great' king Antiochos III of the Seleukids when he attempted to loot our temples, as well as drove back Antiochos IV when he attempted the same."

  cappadocia_ariarathes_heritage_desc:0 "While various cowardly and self-seeking satraps of the Achaemenid empire surrendered to Alexander the Great of Macedonia, the satrap of Cappadocia and later founder of our kingdom Ariarathes I continued to resist the Greek invaders and declared independence from the Hellenistic kingdoms. Though our administration has adopted the Greek language after falling under the influence of the Seleukids, we continue to stand as a Persian stronghold in Asia Minor, and the flames of Ahura Mazda continue to burn in temples across the land. In fact, besides the strategoi and nobles who administer our satrapies, we have also granted land to the priestly class as temple estates."

  galatian_heritage_desc:0 "Generations ago, we Galatians migrated to Anatolia and devastated the Hellenistic rulers, leaving such a mark on the land that our new homeland has been named after our people even in Roman and Greek records. We are respected and feared by Romans and Greeks alike for our fierce warriors, who were hired as mercenaries from Hellas to Egypt. Each of our tribes consists of a tetrarchy and make up a military aristocracy that rules over the local Anatolians, who live separately from the Galatian ruling class and are allowed autonomy in return for tribute."
